				from (select member_id,
		
					count(reserved_for) as Reservations,
		
					count(signed_in_at) as Complete
	
				      from clubready_reservations

				      group by member_id) as subquery
    
				union
				select member_id,
		
					Reservations,
        
					Complete

					count(reserved_at) as Reservations,
		
					count(checked_in_at) as Complete
	
				      from mindbody_reservations
    
				      where MONTH(reserved_at) = 02

				order by Reservations, Complete;

	Answer: Member_id 6 reserved 5 classes in February and completed all 5 classes.


7. Write a query that unions the `mindbody_reservations` table and `clubready_reservations` table as cleanly as possible.



		select member_id, studio_key, class_tag, reserved_for, signed_in_at
		
from clubready_reservations
		
union all
		
select member_id, studio_key, class_tag, reserved_at, checked_in_at
		
from mindbody_reservations;	


### Project Discussion

1. What opportunities do you see to improve data storage and standardization for these datasets?


	Having clubready and mindbody have the same fields would be helpful in comparing the two tables across all available variables. 
	Naming convention for each table being consistent would also help (i.e. reserved_for and reserved_at being the same, since they convey
		the same data).
	
2. What forecasting opportunities do you see with a dataset like this and why?


	Using the data in these tables allow us to predict when classes are most likely to be reserved, both time of day and day of week. We can
		also look at trends through the month (i.e. are reservations made in the beginning of the month moreso than later in the month).
	We can see trends in how far out a reservation is made compared to if that reservation is canceled or missed. This can help in
		determining the window allowed for future reservations. If, say, 70% of reservations are missed when reserved two weeks prior to 
		the class, but only 30% are missed when reserved 7 days prior to the class, the window allowed for reservations could be changed
		to 7 days to reduce the number of missed classes.
	
3. What other data would you propose we gather to make reporting/forecasting more robust and why?
	
	For the mindbody table, including the level would allow for tracking if members move up in level of classes and would allow for 
		prediction of when that would happen. 
	If ads/marketing is used in or for the app/website, including gender and age in the tables would allow for more specific marketing to 
		either groups that are already using PeerFit to bring in more of that group, or to market to other smaller groups not 
		represented in the data as much.
